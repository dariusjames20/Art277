   	Travelling in Depression

   <p style="padding: 25px; font-size: 14px;">
   	When I was very little, I caught the travel bug, It was strated after my gradepoints first brought me to their home in <br>France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries. Each has given me a wnique learning experience.<br>
   	At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco <br> feeding hordes of pigeons, then glided down Venetian waterways on sleek gondolas. At thirteen, I saw the ancient,<br> megalithic structure of stonehenge and walked along the Great wal of China, amazed that the thousand-year-old <br> stones were still in place.
   	<br>
    <br>
  
  	It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.

  It began with French, whi  ch taugh me the importance of pronunciation.I<br>
  remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides, was.<br>But when I pronounced it PYR-a-mides instead of pyr-A-mides, with more<br>accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.
  <br>
  <br>
  	In the eight grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its<br>similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spain, for example, is<br> beisbol, which looks different but sound nearly the same. This was incredible<br>to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find <br>that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in<br>Spanish.
  <br>
  <br>
  	Then, in high school, I developed an enthuisiasm for Chinese. As I studied<br> Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a<br>character, the meaning is lost. I love how long words were formed by <br> combining simpler characters, so  Huǒ (火)  meaning fire and  Shān (山)  meaning<br> mountain can be joined to create  Huǒshān (火山), wich means vocano. love
  	<br>
   spending hours at time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I from them.
